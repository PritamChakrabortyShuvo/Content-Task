4. **Customization Feature:** Being a local Cloud Service Provider, they are often more flexible in offering scalable solutions that fit specific business needs.

### Cons of Using Tenbyte

1. **Limited Under Bangladesh :** Unlike global giants like Amazon Web Service, Azure and Google Cloud, Tenbyte's infrastructure is based under Bangladesh. If a business needs to serve customers or host applications outside Bangladesh, Tenbyte might not be the best choice because of possible high latency and limited international reach.
2. **Absence of a Kubernetes or Container Service:** In their listed services, they do not mention about a dedicated managed Kubernetes Service, container orchestration, or any kind of container service. Without a managed container service, a business must spend a lot of time and skill on maintaining the cluster itself. This is a big drawback for developing modern, cloud native applications.
3. **Pricing in USD:** Their pricing is in U.S. dollars. This can put local businesses in Bangladesh at risk of currency fluctuations and make payments more complicated.

## 02. Robi Cloud

**Robi Axiata**, a leader in Bangladesh's mobile network sector, has expanded its network into the cloud industry through its subsidiary, Axentec PLC.. They have launched Robi Cloud a robust cloud platform. What makes Robi different? It is their large and established network infrastructure.

3. **BDT Pricing:** Robi Cloud's pricing is shown in Bangladeshi Taka (BDT). This is a key benefit for Bangladeshi local businesses because it removes the currency risk and makes financial planning and payments easier compared to other cloud service providers like Tenbyte which price in U.S. dollars.

### Cons of Robi Cloud

1. **Scalability Concerns:** Although the Tier-IV data center claims to be provides high reliability but the overall scalability of the platform may not match the near infinite capacity of a global hyperscaler. Businesses with unpredictable, massive scaling needs might face limitations.
2. **Potential for High Costs:** While some services have competitive prices, their Tier-IV data center and advanced managed services like Kubernetes may cost more than some other local providers.
3. **No International Presence:** Unlike global cloud providers like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Robi Cloud does not have any Points of Presence (PoPs) in other countries. This means they cannot offer low latency services to users outside of Bangladesh like Tenbyte Cloud.

## 03. Brilliant Cloud

**Brilliant Cloud** a part of Intercloud Limited is another important local Cloud Service Provider company in Bangladesh. It claims to be the "First Bangladeshi Public Cloud Platform." The company draws on its parent organization's knowledge as an Internet Service Provider and IT Enabled Services provider to deliver a variety of cloud services. They focus on providing solutions for both small and large organizations.

### Pros of Brilliant Cloud

1. **Comprehensive IaaS Offerings :** Brilliant Cloud provides a strong set of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) options.

### Cons of Brilliant Cloud

**1. Scalability Concerns :** While they provide a scalable solution the overall capacity and unlimited resources of a global cloud provider may not be matched by Brilliant Cloud.
**2. Limited Service Portfolio :** While Brilliant Cloud excels at IaaS it lacks in many managed services that are common on global platforms like AWS or Azure. It does not offer a managed Kubernetes service or other Platform as a Service (PaaS) tools. This makes it less suitable for businesses with modern cloud native application architectures.
**3. Limited Global Reach :** Similar to other local providers, Brilliant Cloud's infrastructure is also confined to Bangladesh.

## 04. MirCloud

**Mir Cloud** is an important part of Bangladesh's cloud market. Backed by the reputable Mir Telecom Group, a name known for telecom infrastructure, they have positioned themselves as a reliable provider of cloud services. They are trying to give businesses a top-notch platform, focusing on bringing world-class infrastructure to the local market. The company is under the brand name of Coloasia a leading data center provider in Bangladesh.

3. **Local Support :** They offer 24/7 in country support. It is a team of experts who understand the local market needs. So if anything goes wrong users can get help fast in Bengali language.
4. **Fixed Minimum :** The 50 GB minimum storage is tied to their basic VM plans meaning user can't reduce it even if their workload only requires a less workload.

### Cons of Mir Cloud

1. **No Managed Kubernetes Service :** They don't offer a managed Kubernetes service like Robi Cloud. For modern developers building cloud native apps this is a major drawback for them. Developers have to manage their own Kubernetes cluster on their VMs, which is a lot of extra work and need lots of Hardware Resources.
2. **Pricing in USD :** Their pricing is listed in USD ($). This exposes local businesses to the risk of currency fluctuations. It can make payments a bit complicated since the cost in Bangladeshi Taka (BDT) can change unexpectedly.
3. **Limited Global Reach :** Their services are focused on the local market. If a business needs to serve customers worldwide they would definitely face extreme high latency and would not be able to leverage the global data center networks of companies like AWS or Azure.

## 05. Pico Cloud

The **Pico Public Cloud**, led by Fiber@Home and Mirantis, is an ambitious project in the land of Bangladesh with a target to create a native public cloud. The project was put in place to meet the increasing need for a secure and local cloud offering, especially in the government and enterprise markets. They make public cloud services their specialty, and tout the ability to deploy easily and rapidly.

### Pros of Pico Cloud

1. **Sovereign Cloud :** Pico Public Cloud ensures all data are kept and processed within national boundary of Bangladesh. This is a key benefit for any organization with data sovereignty constraints such as those in finance and government.
2. **Open Source Backbone :** The platform is based on Mirantis OpenStack for Kubernetes platform (MOSK), a powerful open-source offering. This offers businesses more flexibility and also helps them avoid the risk of being locked to a single vendor, a worry with most proprietary cloud providers. By utilizing OpenStack, the platform is also very compatible with a variety of open-source tools and apps.
3. **Ultra-Low Latency :** Utilising the capabilities of Fiber@Home's vast nationwide fibre network, Pico Cloud is able to provide ultra-low latency. That is important for real-time applications, financial transactions and other services that require a rapid response.

### Cons of Pico Cloud

1. **Geographical Limitation :** The service is designated for Bangladeshi market. For companies with global operations or a global customer base, the absence of an international network of datacenters is a downside which would lead to a higher level of latency for users who aren’t based in Bangladesh.
2. **Scale Limitations :** In spite of being designed to scale, the capacity of the platform is dwarfed by that of global cloud providers being near-infinite. Businesses needing wildly massive and unpredictable scaling may find some shortcomings.
3. **Potential Confusion :** The name "Pico" is associated with a different global company that offers financial services cloud solutions. This could create brand confusion for international clients and partners.
